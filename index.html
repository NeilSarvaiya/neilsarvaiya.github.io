                                <p>As the title says, I like to think of myself as an avid reader. It started as a recommendation from my English teacher to help with reading comprehension because, in her words, my vocabulary was garbage (politely). I had an 85 by the way. The first book I read was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (yes, I started with the third one). Honestly, I barely remember it. Back then, finishing a book felt more satisfying than actually learning from it.
                                </p>
                                <p>Now, I'd say my reading maturity has improved. I actually enjoy the books I read, and finishing the last page usually leaves me feeling the saddest, at least most of the time. I also like to do tiny book reviews on my X account. </p>

                                <p> 
                                    Oh badminton, my beloved. You made me work for you, but you were my first real obsession. For anyone wondering, badminton isn't a girl, it's a sport. It all started during covid when I was a big chunky kid and my parents asked my brother to take me to play so I could lose weight. From the moment I picked up a racket, I was hooked. From Grade 6 to Grade 9, I'd go to the rec centre every day after school, join a club, and spend hours watching videos on footwork and drills. My goal was to become the Edmonton City Champion, and eventually, I was one. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The picture on the right with me and my brother was right after I won city championships. My brother had coached me through the whole process and he himself is actually a city champion in a city called Kamloops, sharing this moment was really special to me. (I'm taller then him now don't worry). Even though I don't play as much now, badminton taught me focus, discipline, and consistency. It got me into fitness and dieting and showed me how to learn from people with more experience. 
                                </p>

                                <p>Despite my amazing athletic prowess as you saw in my last hobby, I'm sad to say that my badminton skills did not transfer to running. I've been running consistently since the start of August 2025, so I'm definitely a noobie runner. I actually dislike running, but I think having something in your day that you dislike just makes the rest of the day seem so much better. Like If I gotta do a run in the morning and I'm dying, then the rest of the day I'm so much more grateful that I don't have to do it again until tommorow.  </p>
                                <p> <--- Me doing 10k. So far, I've only done one OFFICIAL 10km run (I've run more during training) during the summer of '24 and now I'm training to do a half-marathon once I turn 16 next year. (I have to be a certain age to run a half-marathon, the cons of being young) This is my training schedule until June 2026.</p>

                                <p>Now, although I am quite amazing at everything you've seen so far, I'm not afraid to admit that I do have some weaknesses, and cooking is one of them. I mostly help my mom cook meals for the whole family, (cuz I'm just an amazing son yk). But occasionally, I do make food.
                                    I'm not sure if watching a lot of cooking shows makes me interested in food, but I've often told my brother that if I was very wealthy I would want to make a restaurant. Even if restaurants have terrible profit margins. </p>
                                <p>On the side here, are some of the foods I've made on my own. You can judge them for yourself (they look better than they taste). </p>

                                <h3>Making Videos</h3>
                                <p>The iterative conceptualization and synthesis of digital communicative assets for targeted consumption, or in other words, content creation, is something I've done as a hobby back when I was 7 years old. Back then, I was making amateur skits and gaming videos, and it was only recently that I actually made the idea of Naturally Curious. I always liked the idea of making something and having it be open for millions of people to see. Even if there aren't millions of people actually watching it, I think it's cool to know that it's possible to make a community of people who think exactly like you. </p>
                                <p>Honestly though, when I first told the people around me about my videos, I unfortunately was met with a lot of criticism and backlash for trying to make something as ambitious as a successful Youtube Channel, but at the same time, I believe it's important to try things that you genuinely enjoy even if some people find it out of the ordinary.
